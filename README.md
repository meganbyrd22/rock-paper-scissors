The Odin Project - Rock, Paper, Scissors project for Javascript skill development 

The rock, paper, scissors project was the first Javascript project completed as part of The Odin Project Fundamentals course. The project includes an interactive website where the user plays rock, paper, scissors against the computer. The user selects their move by clicking a button and the score is tallied unti one player earns 5 points. A winner message is displayed after each round and at the end of the game. Should I have had more time to spend on the project, I would have added more style for a more enjoyable user experience.

The most valuable thing I learned with this project was to ask for help! I spent entirely too much time struggling on my own and gained immediate clarity upon asking questions in the Discord channel.
